# Voltage-Based-Counter-with-PIC16F877
This project is a simple assembly program for the PIC16F877 microcontroller that reads an input voltage via the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and controls a 7-segment display to show a cyclic counter. The counter increases or decreases based on the input voltage level.
